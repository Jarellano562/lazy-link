### DESCRIPTION 

This is a new free project that the Dudes create to help the average mom and pop businesses. Due to these testing times because of the COVID19 pandemic it is safe to say that no one wants to get the infection. But how does one promote their business and still stay safe from the VID. It is easy with our new generated URL shortner and QR code - you’ll be able to promote your business easier and safely.

### USER STORY 

```text
As a new YouTuber, small business owner or just you're average joe
I want to get my name out there so I could gain market share 
My marketing efforts include posting my website/QR code everywhere
```

### WHY THIS APP

```text
It's free and if that's not a good enough reason well here are some more.... 
This application will help users take long URLs (which can be long) and transform
them into a manageable link. This is the same ideology behind QR Codes.
- It saves space when displayed/printed/message or tweeting 
- Users are less likely to mistype shortner URLs 
- Optimize link across devices, tracking link history and hiding affiliated 
original URLs
```
